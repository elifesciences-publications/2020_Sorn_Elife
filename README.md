**Instructions for using code**
1. ifn_stochastic(pretreatTime, numb_of_cells)
	- To use this function, input pretreatment	time of IFN-alpha and the desired number of cells you want. The output of this function is IRF9 induction and USP18 level at the onset of the second stimulation.
	- Fig6 contains 3 separate experiments, namely 2hr, 10hr and 24hr pretreatment experiments. 

2. ifn_pretreat(pretreatTime)
	- This function outputs the induction of IRF9 when different pretreatment time of IFN-alpha is given to the cells. The only input needed for using this function is pretreatment time. 
	- The bar chart in fig3 contains 3 experiments, namely 2hr, 10hr and 24hr pretreatment experients.
